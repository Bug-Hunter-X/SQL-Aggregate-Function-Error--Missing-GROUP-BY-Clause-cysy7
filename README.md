This repository demonstrates a common SQL error: using aggregate functions without a corresponding GROUP BY clause. The `bug.sql` file contains a query that attempts to calculate the average salary for each department, but it's missing the `GROUP BY` clause. This leads to incorrect results because the database will return a single, likely meaningless average across all departments.  The `bugSolution.sql` file shows how to correct this error by adding the necessary `GROUP BY` clause to correctly aggregate data by department.
